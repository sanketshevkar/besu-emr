## Prerequisites

To run these tutorials, you must have the following installed:

- [Docker and Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

| ⚠️ **Note**: If on MacOS or Windows, please ensure that you allow docker to use upto 4G of memory or 6G if running Privacy examples under the _Resources_ section. The [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/) and [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/) sites have details on how to do this at the "Resources" heading       |

- On Windows ensure that the drive that this repo is cloned onto is a "Shared Drive" with Docker Desktop
- On Windows we recommend running all commands from GitBash
- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/node)



## Usage 

Change directory to the artifacts folder: 

`cd quorum-test-network` (default folder location) 
 
**To start services and the network:**

`./run.sh` starts all the docker containers

**To stop services :**

`./stop.sh` stops the entire network, and you can resume where it left off with `./resume.sh` 

`./remove.sh ` will first stop and then remove all containers and images

To implement the basic fucntions of the smart contracts and deploy smart contracts on the network. Follow the following steps:

```
cd besu-ehr
npm install
node scripts/index.js
```
